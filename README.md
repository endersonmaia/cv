##Projects &amp; Interests

**GitHub - pgp2p**, [https://github.com/endersonmaia/pgp2p](https://github.com/endersonmaia/pgp2p), *February 2011 - April 2011*

p2p, peer-to-peer, distributed-authentication, digital-certificate, web-of-trust, security

PGP and P2P Java experiment.
  
This project was the prove of concept of my M.S. Dissertation.

&quot;In recent years many systems have adopted the architecture of peer-to-peer to take advantage of its main characteristics such as high availability and scalability. When it comes to authentication P2P networks generally use a central entity, where each new user to access this server to authenticate itself and only from there can join the network. In this approach, the unavailability of this service may compromise access for all users to network resources. The high cost to solve the problem of availability and scalability in a centralized solution becomes impractical. To solve this problem some proposals to distribute the authentication service in a P2P network among its participants are investigated . It was identified that the use of digital certificates is a requirement to solve the problem of false identities in P2P networks, ensuring that the authentication service could be run on every node. This work propose an architecture of an authentication system purely peer-to-peer that can reside on any node in the network, all the source code is available under an opensource license and all requirements identified during the study were evaluated by testing scenarios demonstrating the technical feasibility of the solution.
